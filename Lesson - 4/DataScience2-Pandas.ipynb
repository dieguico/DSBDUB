    "# Advanced programming for data analysis: pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to work with relational or labeled data both. It is a fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is well suited for:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet\n",
    "+ Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.\n",
    "+ Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Easy handling of missing data\n",
    "+ Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame\n",
    "+ Powerful, flexible ``group by`` functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets\n",
    "+ Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets\n",
    "+ Intuitive merging and joining data sets\n",
    "+ Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets\n",
    "+ Hierarchical labeling of axes\n",
    "+ Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files, Excel files, databases, and HDF5\n",
    "+ Time series functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.\n"
